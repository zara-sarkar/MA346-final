# MA346-final
This project contains the dashboard, report, and code for my Data Science final project. The purpose of this project is to explore a dataset that contains details from an e-commerce site. I utilized various services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to load, store, and query the data. I first used Amazon S3 to store the data. I then used Amazon Gluemaker to extract, load, and transfer the data in the database, which was Amazon Athena. I finally used Amazon Athena to perform SQL queries on the data in order to create different visualizations. In order to create the dashboard, I used Amazon Quicksight.
